Welcome! I am **Mani Dhakal**, a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Mathematics at the University of North Texas](https://math.unt.edu/) undet a supervision of [Dr. Rajeev K. Azad](https://scholars.unt.edu/en/persons/rajeev-azad). Currently, I am focusing on developing various mathematical models ranging from extension of *SIR* to advance agent base models. My developed models are particularly focused on co-infection dynamics in humans. I apply various mathematical and computational concepts in deciphering the intericate dynamics resulting from co-occurence of multiple viruses.

Further, I have also made myself familiar with skills like integrating genomic and epidemiological data to enhance outbreak analysis, and  use of *arcGIS Pro* to understanding the spatio-temporal dynamics of various infectious diseases.
*Following are my core competencies:*
* *Infectious Disease Modeling:* Familiar with compartmental models (e.g., SEAIHR, SEIR) for studying single and multi-pathogen interactions, including co-infections such as COVID-19, influenza, and MRSA.
* *Data Integration:* Practical experience in combining genomic and epidemiological data using tools like outbreaker2 to analyze transmission dynamics.
* *Mathematical and Computational Modeling:* Engaged in the development and exploration of deterministic and stochastic models for disease transmission.
* *Programming & Statistical Tools:* Working knowledge of Python, R (including ggraph and outbreaker2), for computational tasks and visualizations.

** Professional Strengths:**
* Strong foundational skills in mathematical modeling and computational analysis.
* Practical experience collaborating with professors and peers on multidisciplinary research projects.
* Passionate about learning and applying new tools and methodologies to advance infectious disease research.


## Research Interests

My research interests include mathematical biosciences, machine learning for biological data, and spatio-temporal epidemiological modeling. I am currently focused on:
* Mechanistic modeling of virus-virus co-infections.
* Decomposing transmission pathways in co-epidemics like COVID-19 and influenza.
* Developing novel threshold frameworks for multi-pathogen dynamics.
  
* Future Goals:*
* Mechanistic modeling of virus-bacteria co-infections.
* Exploring vaccination strategies and antibiotic resistance in co-infection scenarios within high-risk settings.
* Investigating the role of climate change in altering infectious disease transmission patterns.
* Use of artificial intelligence (AI) in infectious disease modeling.


## News
* **August 2025**: Our paper, "[Mechanistic Models of Virusâ€“Bacteria Co-Infections in Humans: A Systematic Review of Methods and Assumptions](https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens14080830)," was published in *Pathogens*.
* **Spring 2025**: I presented my research on influenza and COVID-19 co-infection dynamics at the BDI & AERI Research Expo and the American Society for Microbiology TX Branch meeting.
