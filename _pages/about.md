Welcome! I am **Mani Dhakal**, a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Mathematics at the University of North Texas](https://math.unt.edu/). My research is advised by [Dr. Rajeev K. Azad](https://scholars.unt.edu/en/persons/rajeev-azad) and focuses on applied mathematics and epidemiological modeling.

I am passionate about developing mathematical models to understand and predict the dynamics of infectious diseases, with a special interest in co-infections and multi-pathogen systems.

## Research Interests

My research interests include mathematical biosciences, machine learning for biological data, and spatio-temporal epidemiological modeling. I am particularly focused on:
* Mechanistic modeling of virus-bacteria co-infections.
* Decomposing transmission pathways in co-epidemics like COVID-19 and influenza.
* Developing novel threshold frameworks for multi-pathogen dynamics.

## News
* **September 2025**: I recently became a member of the [Association of Nepalese Mathematicians in America (ANMA)](https://anmaonline.org/).
* **August 2025**: Our paper, "[Mechanistic Models of Virusâ€“Bacteria Co-Infections in Humans: A Systematic Review of Methods and Assumptions](https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens14080830)," was published in *Pathogens*.
* **Spring 2025**: I presented my research on influenza and COVID-19 co-infection dynamics at the BDI & AERI Research Expo and the American Society for Microbiology TX Branch meeting.
